    <h3>Welcome to my hobby site!</h3>
    <p>This was created for the purposes of organizing and sharing my projects, hobbies, and interests. 
    Particularly, this site was created as a place to document the set-up, enjoyment, and maintenance of my PC-9801/DA and BX.</p>
    <p>Inspiration for this site was taken from <a href="https://alf-s-room.com/">Alf's Room</a>, which I high recommend poking around.</p>
