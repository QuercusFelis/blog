            This last spring I imported 2 PC-98s, a BX and a DA, along with a smattering of games for each using the <a href=https://japamart.com>japamart</a> forwarding service. 
            After waiting a few months for them to arrive, due to COVID shipping delays, they unfortunately sat unused until now due to the numerous other things necessary to get them running.
            I am making this post today, however, because that is no longer the case! I currently have the BX hooked up through HDMI to a 50" TV and it looks fantastic!
            The details for how that was managed will be in its own post.
            <br><br>
            There are a number of reasons I specifically bought two. First and foremost is game compatibility, some games are 5" floppies and others come in 3.5" floppies. 
            If you want to play both you'll need 2 working drives for each form factor. 
            Finding an appropriate external drive is significantly more difficult than just buying two different models, and at the time I was importing mine, there were none for sale on Yahoo Auctions. 
            Another reason is redundancy, if I am having issues with one and it needs repair or something of the sort, I will still have the other to play around with. 
            Finally, PC-98s are actually quite affordable and importing a second one at the same time as the first was not significantly more effort.
            <br><br>
            There were some challenges with the process though. On one of the auctions I won, the PC-98 came with a CRT, mouse, and keyboard. 
            I had believed at the time that the CRT could simply be packed in a separate box for international shipping. I was wrong. 
            Despite my forwarding service's gracious and best efforts, it was too large to be accepted by Japan Post, at which point my options were to pay for DHL, which would cost upwards of $1000 in shipping or pay a small disposal fee. 
            When buying a PC-98 from Japan, be sure to avoid any auction with a CRT, as it is unlikely you will be able to have it shipped to you in one piece for any reasonable fee.

            There is also the issue of storage fees when ordering a large number of items over any significant time period.
            To avoid extra international shipping costs, it's best to allow the forwarder to ship as many items as possible at once so they can pack them more efficiently.
            However, this also means you have to wait for everything to be in the forwarder's hands before you can ship, and if this takes too long you may have to pay a small storage fee.
            Luckily, I didn't have any issues with this, but it's definitely something to be aware of. There is no shortage of various small fees to watch out for.
            <br><br>
            When all of this was said and done, everything arrived mostly in tact. The box with the PC-9801 DA was, however, dropped quite violently somtime during shipping. 
            This resulted in an impressive dent on one corner of the case extreme enough to bend the entire back half into a zig zag.
            The DA is built like a tank though, and after bending it back into shape it's 100% functional, just slightly uglier (no one seems to notice, lol).
            Cosmetic damage or no, its charm and good looks was never a particular selling point for the DA. ;P
